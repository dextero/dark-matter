Hints
-----

* Use `vagrant ssh -- -X` to allow remote X forwarding over SSH
* To run visualization/lens\_plane.py, rename 'cutLens' to 'cutPlaneAngular'
* If X windows close immediately after showing when running visualization/*.py scripts, add following line to the end of them:

```lang=python
mlab.show()
```
